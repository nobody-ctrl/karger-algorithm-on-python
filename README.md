# karger-algorithm-on-python
This is my implementation of Karger's algorithm

Nodes and edges are in file kargerMinCut.txt:

-all numbers are nodes

-each line indicates edges, e.g. first number ist the node, which has all other neighbors in this line

Example: 1 2 4 5 mean that graph V={1,2,3,4} and E={{1,2}, {1,4}, {1,5}}
